# lightcc_superadventure_cs_tutorial

This is the code that I have built from the [Learn C# by building a simple RPG](https://github.com/LightCC/lightcc_superadventure_cs_tutorial) tutorial,
which is developed and released by Scott Lilly.

I started saving this to a git repo several lessons in, so it picks up part-way through.
I have branches that test out various things I am interested in, such as adding unit tests.
The `master` branch is intended to have direct code that follows the lessons, with other
branches either being a feature branch where a new lesson is being worked on, or a separate
development (such as adding unit tests).

This tutorial teachs you C#, object-oriented programming, refactoring, WinForms windows
programming (at least the basics), several different aspects of the .NET libraries,
basic XML, basic database setup and programming, etc. It does this all in a very
easy-to-follow manner where the lessons just happen naturally.

On Scott's site you can find a newer tutorial which recreates the same "Superadventure"
game, but with the newer WPF graphics framework, rather than WinForms, and makes
several other updates along the way. I highly recommend fully completing both
tutorials as a thorough introduction to C#, pretty much from scratch, that eases you
into programming and C# across the board. He also has some good videos on "Design Patterns".
I'm a fan.
